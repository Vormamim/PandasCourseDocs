# Assessment Task

#### **Introduction**

In the second part of this unit, you will apply everything you've learned in a **hands-on Python Data Analysis Project**. This task is your chance to demonstrate your ability to:

* Define and investigate a problem using real-world data
* Manipulate and visualise data using **Pandas and Matplotlib**
* Design a simple user interface using **CustomTkinter**
* Follow software development practices including **testing** and **version control**

Over the next four weeks, you‚Äôll move through the complete data analysis process ‚Äì from defining a problem to presenting your findings in a fully working Python program.

***

### **Project Overview**

You will use **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and CustomTkinter** to investigate a dataset and present your findings in the form of an interactive dashboard or console-based application. You must use the coding and data skills you developed during the course ‚Äî **no Excel, no Jupyter Notebook**.

***

### **Project Phases**

#### üîé **Phase 1: Define the Problem**

* **Choose Your Data Scenario**: Select one scenario provided (e.g. health activity data, solar energy, environmental sensors).
* **Define Your Purpose**: Clearly describe the question or issue you're exploring.
* **Specify Requirements**:
  * Functional: What must your program do?
  * Non-functional: Qualities like usability, reliability, responsiveness.
* **Create Use Cases**: Briefly describe how a user would interact with your dashboard or script.

***

#### **Phase 2: Plan and Prepare**

* **Plan Your Dataset**:
  * Create a short **data dictionary** for your CSV file or API.
  * Sketch a simple **data flow** ‚Äì how is the data filtered, analysed, and displayed?
* **Choose a Dataset**:
  * You may use the class-provided datasets or a relevant one you find.
  * Ensure it respects **privacy and cybersecurity principles**.

***

#### **Phase 3: Build Your Solution**

You must now **write your Python program**, using only the tools and libraries taught in class:

* **Pandas** for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib** for visualisations
* **CustomTkinter** for a GUI (optional but required for full marks)

Your program must:

* Load, clean, and filter data from a `.csv` file
* Generate **at least 3 different visualisations**
* Allow user interaction via:
  * Entry boxes, dropdowns, or buttons (GUI), **or**
  * A text-based interface with typed input
* Include **a refresh or update function** (e.g., change graph or result based on input)

***

#### **Phase 4: Test and Evaluate**

* **Test** your project thoroughly. Ensure your filters, calculations, and charts work correctly.
* **Evaluate** your outcome:
  * Did it meet the original purpose and requirements?
  * What could be improved?
  * How did you solve issues during development?
* **Peer Verification**: Exchange code with a classmate and give/receive feedback on correctness, clarity, and logic.

| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ `main.py` or `dashboard.py` | Your Python program with all visualisation and interaction features                                 |
| ‚úÖ Dataset(s)                  | `.csv` file(s) used in your project (include in your GitHub repo)                                   |
| ‚úÖ Visualisation screenshots   | PNGs of your charts OR embedded in your GUI                                                         |
| ‚úÖ Project reflection          | A written document (in Markdown or Word) reflecting on your planning, testing, and what you learned |
| ‚úÖ Peer review form            | Give feedback to 1 classmate and upload their feedback to you                                       |

***

### üìÅ **How to Submit**

* All work must be pushed to your **GitHub repo**
* Submit the GitHub link with:
  * Your `main.py` file
  * The dataset(s)
  * Your reflection and peer feedback
  * Screenshots or embedded visuals

***

### üîí **Reminder**

You are not allowed to:

* Use Excel, Jupyter, or online GUI tools
* Copy from external Python dashboards or notebooks
* Use libraries we haven‚Äôt covered in this course
