# 1. Data verses information

### What’s the Difference Between Data and Information?

**Data** is raw and unorganised — just facts, numbers, or measurements.

**Information** is what we get when we give **context** to data and make it meaningful.

| Example                           | Type        |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `54`                              | Data        |
| `54 people attended the workshop` | Information |

Think of data as **ingredients**. Information is the **cooked meal**.

### Why Analyse Data?

We analyse data to:

* Discover patterns and trends
* Make better decisions
* Solve problems
* Predict outcomes

> Example: A school uses attendance data to spot patterns in absences and support students.

### The 5 Parts of a Data System

| Component               | Meaning                       | Example                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Input**               | Where data comes from         | Student logs attendance                      |
| **Storage**             | Where data is kept            | Excel file, Google Sheet, database           |
| **Process**             | How data is analysed          | Summarising, filtering, calculating averages |
| **Output**              | The result shown to users     | Weekly attendance report                     |
| **Feedback** (optional) | Adjustments based on analysis | Teacher follows up with absent students      |
