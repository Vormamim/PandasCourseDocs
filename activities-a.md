# Activities A

### Create a NEW Document

Create a document and complete the activities.&#x20;

Give the document a the following title

`nameSurname - Activities A`

This is what you will be handing in on Google Classrooms. Keep updating it as you go.

<mark style="background-color:green;">**Create a new repository on GitHub called "DataScience"**</mark>

### Understanding Data vs Information

#### üóíÔ∏è Quick Notes:

* **Data** = raw facts, numbers, or text (e.g. `42`, `"blue"`)
* **Information** = meaningful data (e.g. `42 students chose blue`)

## Introduction to Data ‚Äì What Is It and Why Does It Matter?

#### üóíÔ∏è Quick Notes

* **Data** = raw facts, numbers, or text (e.g. `42`, `"blue"`)
* **Information** = meaningful data (e.g. `42 students chose blue`)

***

#### Activity 1: Match It!

Copy the table in a Doc and re-oganise; Give an example of how this data could be used inside some form of information. Then suggest what data type would be used for this data.

| **Raw Data** | Data Type | **Information** |
| ------------ | --------- | --------------- |
| 5.8          |           |                 |
| ‚ÄúS‚Äù          |           |                 |
| 27¬∞C         |           |                 |
| ‚ÄúGreen‚Äù      |           |                 |

#### Activity 2: What is the Purpose of Data Analysis?

Choose **two** of the following scenarios and answer:

* What data is being collected?
* Why is the data useful?
* What actions might result from this analysis?

**Scenarios:**

* A fitness app records your daily steps
* A school tracks student lateness
* A supermarket analyses weekly sales
* A TikTok influencer looks at video views

### Data Systems ‚Äî Inputs to Outputs

#### üìí Theory: Components of a Data System

| Component      | Definition               | Example                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Input**      | Where data comes from    | Student logs attendance        |
| **Storage**    | Where data is saved      | Google Sheets, Excel, database |
| **Processing** | What we do with the data | Sort, filter, calculate        |
| **Output**     | What users see           | Dashboard, summary, chart      |
| **Feedback**   | Optional loop            | Adjusting based on output      |

#### Activity 3: Create a Data Flow Diagram

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-O6s5sah4o" %}

Create some simple **data flow diagrams** using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).

* Context Diagram
* A  Level 1 Dataflow Diagram

Choose one:

* A YouTuber analysing video statistics

Label the flow like this:**Input ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Output (+ Feedback if needed)**

#### üîç Activity 4: Investigate the Olympics Dataset

In this course, we will explore **real-world data** from the Olympic Games. The dataset is called `athlete_events.csv` and contains over 270,000 rows of data about athletes who competed in the Olympics from 1896 to 2016.

**üëá Start Here:**

1. Download and open the dataset in Google Sheets, Excel, or using Pandas.
2. Take a moment to scroll through the columns and rows.

{% file src=".gitbook/assets/athlete_events.csv" %}

**Questions to Answer:**

* What does each **column** represent?\
  &#xNAN;_(Hint: Look for things like Name, Sex, Age, Team,...)_
* Which columns are **inputs** (raw data) and which are **outputs** (useful summaries)?
* What might be some **useful questions** we could explore using this data?

**Practical Task: Load with Pandas**

If you're confident using Python, try running this code with Python and the pandas library

To use the pandas library in Python, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Pandas**: If you haven't already installed pandas, you can do so using pip in the terminal:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("athlete_events.csv")
print(df.head())
print(df.columns)
```

**Try using Excel if you're not confident with installing and using Pandas right now.**

#### üéÆ Activity 5: Data Around You ‚Äì Scavenger Hunt

Find and describe **seven real-life data examples**:

| Example                   | Source        | Why It‚Äôs Collected | Who Uses It       |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Example: Bus arrival time | Transport app | To track buses     | Public + Planners |
|                           |               |                    |                   |
|                           |               |                    |                   |
|                           |               |                    |                   |
|                           |               |                    |                   |
|                           |               |                    |                   |
|                           |               |                    |                   |
|                           |               |                    |                   |
